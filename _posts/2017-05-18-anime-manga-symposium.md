Car oui, nous avons été acceptés pour faire une présentation à la conférence académique d'Anime Expo.

> Everyone regularly ask themselves what movie, series or book they
should watch next, according to their taste. Mangaki wants to innovate
access to Japanese culture by providing a unique user experience
through a recommender system.

> When a user shows up, Mangaki asks them to rate a few works. Based on
their answers, they receive tailored anime recommendations. Mangaki's
machine learning techniques attempt to “guess” the taste of new users,
by geometrically positioning their ratings within those collected from
other users. Indeed, we will show that a simple factor analysis on the
anonymized data (325,000 ratings from 2,220 users and 15,000 works)
can reveal interesting and counterintuitive categories of manga that
are liked together.

> Mangaki started as a French student project in 2014 (it is so much fun
to conduct research when it is unleashed on real data!). It received a
prize from Microsoft (2015) and the Japanese Cultural Institute in
Paris (2016): we won a trip to Tokyo to meet Japanese companies and
investors, who were surprised to learn that we wanted to stay
non-profit. The founder now holds a PhD in CS and works as a
researcher in RIKEN, Tokyo.

> In its mission to promote transparency and education, all the code of
the Mangaki platform is open source. Consequently, it becomes possible
for anyone to understand better the algorithms behind recommender
systems. We regularly hold conferences for students, from high school
to master's degree.

> The Mangaki dataset will also be released for academic purposes
(humanities: dōzo!), while respecting the users' privacy. We are
currently organizing a data challenge with Kashima's Machine Learning
Lab in Kyoto University, where students will have to improve the
accuracy of the recommendations. There is plenty of exciting research
yet to be made, notably the automatic detection of NSFW posters using
deep learning.
